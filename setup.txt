IDE:

Dependencies:
   python - 3.6.6

   Numpy - 1.14.2 
   seqeval - 0.0.5
  
Instructions for the execution:
1)Import the repository as a spyder project or create a new project and place all these files.    
1)Before executing, we need to download glove embeddings with 100d file from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
  or https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/glove-global-vectors-for-word-representation 
2)Place the glove embeddings file in 'data' folder
3)Change the constants in configs.py if we want try with other constants/parameters.
  batch_size set to 32 due time constraint. We can decrease batch_size and increase epochs to get good F1-score.
4)Run the model_training.py file which will load the training data and starts the training.
  training progress logs will get printed on the IDE console.
5)Once training is done, model weights will get saved as 'h5' file in current directory. Other information like word_to_index 
  and char_to_index that are required during testing will get saved in other file.
6)To test the model, run test.py which will be re-create the model and model will get loaded with saved weights.
  Data provided in test.txt file will be used to compute F1-score.

NOTE: train.txt, valid.txt and test.txt will be there in data folder.
